# Streamlit-IteruApp
A Google Earth Engine-Based Interactive Web Application for Continuously Monitoring the GERD Reservoir in Ethiopia Using Sentinel-1 SAR GRD, iteru, and geemap.

This work presents an automated processing chain surface water mapping of the GERD reservoir in Ethiopia using Sentinel-1 SAR. A user-friendly interactive web application is built upon this [algorithm](https://github.com/MuhammedM294/Iteru) to allow the public to continuously monitor the waterbody volume variation in this study area. The application leverages the powerful computational capabilities of Google Earth Engine and its continually updated datasets.
